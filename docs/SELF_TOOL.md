# Self Tool

Let the agent sense and adjust its own runtime state — like asking a coworker "are you busy? can you switch to a bigger monitor?"

## Why You Need It

Normal tools let the agent operate on the outside world (read/write files, search code). But the agent knows nothing about itself — it doesn't know which model it's running on, how many iterations are left, or how many tokens it has consumed.

Self tool fills this gap. With it, the agent can:

- **Know who it is**: What model am I using? Where is my workspace? How many iterations remain?
- **Adapt on the fly**: Complex task? Expand the context window. Simple chat? Switch to a faster model.
- **Remember across turns**: Store notes in `_runtime_vars` that persist into the next conversation turn.

## Configuration

Enabled by default (read-only mode). The agent can inspect its state but not modify it.

```yaml
tools:
  self_evolution: true    # default: true
  self_modify: false      # default: false (read-only)
```

To allow the agent to modify its configuration (e.g. switch models, adjust parameters), set `self_modify: true`.

All modifications are held in memory only — restart restores defaults.

## inspect — Check "my" current state

Without parameters, returns a key config overview:

```
self(action="inspect")
# → max_iterations: 40
#   context_window_tokens: 65536
#   model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514'
#   workspace: PosixPath('/tmp/workspace')
#   provider_retry_mode: 'standard'
#   max_tool_result_chars: 16000
```

With a key parameter, drill into a specific config:

```
self(action="inspect", key="_last_usage.prompt_tokens")
# → How many prompt tokens I've used so far

self(action="inspect", key="model")
# → What model I'm currently running on

self(action="inspect", key="web_config.enable")
# → Whether web search is enabled
```

### What you can do with it

| Scenario | How |
|----------|-----|
| "What model are you using?" | `inspect("model")` |
| "How many more tool calls can you make?" | `inspect("max_iterations")` minus current iteration |
| "How many tokens has this conversation used?" | `inspect("_last_usage")` |
| "Where is your working directory?" | `inspect("workspace")` |
| "Show me your full config" | `inspect()` |

## modify — Runtime tuning

Changes take effect immediately, no restart required.

```
self(action="modify", key="max_iterations", value=80)
# → Bump iteration limit from 40 to 80

self(action="modify", key="model", value="fast-model")
# → Switch to a faster model

self(action="modify", key="context_window_tokens", value=131072)
# → Expand context window for long documents
```

You can also store custom state (held in `_runtime_vars`):

```
self(action="modify", key="current_project", value="nanobot")
self(action="modify", key="user_style_preference", value="concise")
self(action="modify", key="task_complexity", value="high")
# → These values persist into the next conversation turn
```

### Protected parameters

These parameters have type and range validation — invalid values are rejected:

| Parameter | Type | Range | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| `max_iterations` | int | 1–100 | Max tool calls per conversation turn |
| `context_window_tokens` | int | 4,096–1,000,000 | Context window size |
| `model` | str | non-empty | LLM model to use |

Other parameters (e.g. `workspace`, `provider_retry_mode`, `max_tool_result_chars`) can be modified freely, as long as the value is JSON-safe.

## Practical Scenarios

### "This task is complex, I need more room"

```
Agent: This codebase is large, let me expand my context window to handle it.
→ self(action="modify", key="context_window_tokens", value=131072)
```

### "Simple question, don't waste compute"

```
Agent: This is a straightforward question, let me switch to a faster model.
→ self(action="modify", key="model", value="fast-model")
```

### "Remember user preferences across turns"

```
Turn 1: self(action="modify", key="user_prefers_concise", value=True)
Turn 2: self(action="inspect", key="user_prefers_concise")
# → True (still remembers the user likes concise replies)
```

### "Self-diagnosis"

```
User: "Why aren't you searching the web?"
Agent: Let me check my web config.
→ self(action="inspect", key="web_config.enable")
# → False
Agent: Web search is disabled — please set web.enable: true in your config.
```

### "Token budget management"

```
Agent: Let me check how much budget I have left.
→ self(action="inspect", key="_last_usage")
# → {"prompt_tokens": 45000, "completion_tokens": 8000}
Agent: I've used quite a few tokens — I'll keep my remaining replies concise.
```

## Safety Mechanisms

Core design principle: **All modifications live in memory only. Restart restores defaults.** The agent cannot cause persistent damage.

### Off-limits (BLOCKED)

| Category | Attributes | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Core infrastructure | `bus`, `provider`, `_running` | Changes would crash the system |
| Tool registry | `tools` | Must not remove its own tools |
| Subsystems | `subagents`, `runner`, `sessions`, etc. | Affects other users/sessions |
| Sensitive data | `_mcp_servers`, `_pending_queues`, etc. | Contains credentials and message routing |
| Python internals | `__class__`, `__dict__`, etc. | Prevents sandbox escape |

### Watchdog safety net

Even if the agent manages to set an out-of-bounds value (e.g. `max_iterations` to 999), the watchdog automatically corrects it at the start of the next iteration.
